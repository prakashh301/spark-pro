# 🚩 Facing **Data Skew** Issues in PySpark? Here Are **5 Powerful Fixes!** ⚡  

One of the biggest performance killers in PySpark is **data skew** – when some partitions have way more data than others, causing slow jobs, failed tasks, and inefficient resource utilization. But don’t worry! Here are **5 powerful techniques** to handle data skew **with real-world examples**! 👇  

---

## 🔥 **1. Salting for Skewed Joins**  
When certain keys appear too frequently, Spark overloads specific partitions, causing bottlenecks. **Solution? Add a random “salt” to distribute the data!**  

🚀 **Example:**  
Imagine you’re joining a **huge transactions table** with a **small region lookup table**, but **one region has 80% of the data**! Instead of a **skewed join**, we use salting:  

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import monotonically_increasing_id, concat_ws

# Add a random salt column to large_df
large_df = large_df.withColumn("salt", (monotonically_increasing_id() % 3))
large_df = large_df.withColumn("region_salted", concat_ws("_", large_df.region, large_df.salt))

# Duplicate small_df with salt values
small_df = small_df.crossJoin(spark.range(3).withColumnRenamed("id", "salt"))
small_df = small_df.withColumn("region_salted", concat_ws("_", small_df.region, small_df.salt))

# Join on salted key
joined_salted_df = large_df.join(small_df, "region_salted", "inner")
```
✅ **Fix:** Spreads the skewed keys across multiple partitions, **eliminating hotspot partitions**!  

---

## 🚀 **2. Use Broadcast Joins for Small Tables**  
If one of your tables is **small (<10MB)**, don’t shuffle millions of records! Instead, **broadcast it to every executor** for an ultra-fast **local join**.  

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast
joined_df = large_df.join(broadcast(small_df), "region", "inner")  # 🚀 No shuffle!
```
✅ **Fix:** No shuffle means **faster execution** and **lower memory consumption**! 🔥  

---

## 🎯 **3. Repartition to Distribute Data Evenly**  
If your Spark job has **uneven partitions**, some executors do all the work while others sit idle. **Manually controlling partitions** solves this!  

```python
large_df = large_df.repartition(10, "region")  # Evenly distributes records across 10 partitions
```
✅ **Fix:** Ensures balanced execution, preventing slowdowns!  

---

## 💡 **4. Optimize Skewed Joins with `skewHint()` (Spark 3+)**  
Tired of manually fixing skewed joins? **Spark 3+ automatically detects skewed keys and optimizes the join!**  

```python
joined_df = large_df.hint("skew", "region").join(small_df, "region", "inner")
```
✅ **Fix:** **No manual tuning!** Spark **dynamically balances partitions** for optimized performance.  

---

## 🏆 **5. Avoid `groupBy` on Skewed Columns (Use Window Functions)**  
`groupBy()` on a skewed column can **overload a few executors**, making jobs painfully slow. **Use window functions instead!**  

```python
from pyspark.sql.window import Window
from pyspark.sql.functions import count

window_spec = Window.partitionBy("region")
large_df = large_df.withColumn("transaction_count", count("value").over(window_spec))
```
✅ **Fix:** **No shuffle!** Spark **processes data efficiently** in each partition.
